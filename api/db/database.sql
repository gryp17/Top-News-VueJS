The bill would also require that claim letters include specific information of a patent infringement.<p>Among other provisions, the bill also seeks to shield small companies or inventors and universities from large monetary judgments if they would result in hardship, and the proposal would make it easier to find patent information in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office so businesses can snuff out frivolous claims.<p>Story Continues ?', '102.jpg', '2015-06-17 00:00:00', 2, 3);

Bernie Sanders, Vermont independent running for president as a Democrat. \"Denying the science related to climate change is no longer acceptable.\"<p>In setting the stage for the Paris climate conference, Francis even mentions the failure of previous global efforts, which include a widely hyped 2009 summit in Copenhagen that ultimately produced very little in the way of international response to climate change.<p>\"It is remarkable how weak international political responses have been. The failure of global summits on the environment makes it plain that our politics are subject to technology and finance. There are too many special interests, and economic interests easily end up trumping the common good and manipulating information so that their own plans will not be affected,\" he said. \"Consequently, the most one can expect is superficial rhetoric, sporadic acts of philanthropy and perfunctory expressions of concern for the environment, whereas any genuine attempt by groups within society to introduce change is viewed as a nuisance based on romantic illusions or an obstacle to be circumvented.\"<p>Heading into the Paris summit, Mr. Obama has proposed a host of new regulations to combat climate change, including dramatic new restrictions on carbon emissions from power plants.

Wilson plans to jump again Sunday in his last chance to qualify for the U.S. championships.<p>Wilson jumped 48 feet, 1 1/4 inches Saturday; he had posted a wind-aided 53-1 3/4 in college. He last competed in 2011, when he finished sixth at the NCAA meet for Virginia Tech.<p>Because of a hamstring injury, Wilson hadn\'t tried a full 12-step approach in practice. He assumed that going full speed would allow him to jump farther, but instead it just reminded him he needs to lose more weight. Saturday\'s experience was a physics lesson: When he made his initial hop, the additional momentum in fact slowed him down because those extra pounds were generating the wrong kind of force.<p>\"All the speed I had built up, stopped,\" he said, and he didn\'t feel in control of the jump.<p>So Wilson plans to return to eight steps Sunday, the most he\'s done in practice, when he\'s jumped 51 feet. He had been hoping for at least 53-9 on Saturday.<p>Cuba\'s Pedro Pablo Pichardo won with 57-7 1/2.<p>A state champion triple jumper in high school, Wilson could never devote much time to track and field in college because of his football commitments. But after a serious neck injury forced the former first-round draft pick to retire from the NFL at age 23 in August, he decided to give the triple jump another try.<p>His goal is to qualify for the 2016 Rio Olympics, hopeful he can make major improvements now that he\'s dedicated to track full time.<p>As an NFL rookie in 2012, Wilson led the league with a franchise-record 1,533 kickoff return yards. But he was hurt only five games into his second season, when an MRI revealed a narrowing of his spinal cord. Wilson underwent surgery and returned for training camp.<p>But then during a drill, he caught a pass, put his head down and ran into the back of an offensive lineman. That hit caused numbness in his hands and lower extremities.<p>Doctors advised him to quit football. Triple jumping poses no risk because there\'s no contact.<p>Wilson played at about 210 pounds, but now he\'s competing against rivals in the 140-170 range. He had gotten as low as 189 and hopes to reach 180-185 pounds to improve on Saturday\'s debut.<p>\"I wasn\'t proud the way I performed,\" he said. \"But it was a good experience because I got my feet wet in a professional atmosphere, and now next time when I do get right in training, do get down to the weight I want to be, do get my technique perfect - I\'ll be knowing what to expect.\"', '14.jpg', '2015-06-13 00:00:00', 2, 5);

Treinen\'s throw to first base sailed over Danny Espinosa\'s head. Bryce Harper then collected the ball and threw it past catcher Jose Lobaton. Souza jogged home on the error to complete the rare \"Little League home run.\"<p>\"If it\'s dry, I\'m probably not even thinking about [bunting], to be honest with you,\" Souza said. \"It\'s tough to throw a wet ball in the rain.

So, everything that he stuck with me, just really his relationship with me, it means a lot.

Jordan Zimmermann was solid but unspectacular, allowing three earned runs, and a sloppy eighth inning put the game out of reach.<p>The game was delayed in the middle of the eighth inning because of rain.<hr /><p> SEE ALSO: Nationals notes: Stephen Strasburg throws five innings for Harrisburg in rehab start <hr /><p>THE RUNDOWN: In an untraditional move, the Rays sent reliever Steve Geltz to the mound to start the game before replacing him with Matt Andriese, the game\'s projected starter. It didn\'t matter much, as both pitchers were equally effective against a streaky Nationals lineup. After recording 23 hits and 16 runs in Tampa Bay on Tuesday, Washington crashed down to Earth on Wednesday with a two-hit, no-run performance. Zimmermann had to be almost perfect to keep his sputtering offense in the game, and though he was much better than he was in his last start, he wasn\'t dominant. He surrendered eight hits over seven innings, including a pair of solo homers in the fifth, to give the Rays a lead they would never relinquish.<p>THE HIGHLIGHT: It\'s not exactly a highlight if you\'re a Nationals fan, but it\'s not every day you see a Little League home run like the one Steven Souza Jr. had Wednesday night. In the eighth inning, with a steady rain falling, he laid down a bunt and let the Nationals do the rest. Blake Treinen threw the ball over Danny Espinosa\'s head at first base for an error. Then Bryce Harper tried to throw a runner out at the plate and fired the ball into the Rays\' dugout. Another error. Souza came around to score. Slippery conditions or not, it was ugly.<p>STAR OF THE GAME:Souza only played in 21 big-league games for the Nationals in 2014, but his no-hitter-saving catch in the regular-season finale endeared him to fans here forever. So when he stepped to the plate for his first at-bat Wednesday, it was not surprising that he received a lengthy and loud ovation from the crowd. The cheers ended when Souza singled to left field off Jordan Zimmermann, and they turned to a handful of boos in the fifth, when he hit a solo home run over the visitor\'s bullpen. He finished 3 for 4.<p>THE TAKEAWAY: Given the injuries they\'ve dealt with this season, it\'s unfair to expect the Nationals to be a bastion of offensive efficiency. Their everyday lineup is littered with guys who were expected to be bench players at best. Inconsistency is a given under those circumstances. But the extreme degree of Washington\'s streaks — both positive and negative — has been startling. Beyond Harper, Max Scherzer, Yunel Escobar and Drew Storen, nobody has really been consistent all year. If the Nationals are going to put together some sort of winning streak, they\'ll need to start there: By being more consistent on a nightly basis.', '21.jpg', '2015-06-17 00:00:00', 2, 5);

I could have added that the Secretary of State was understandably trying to put the best face on a bad situation, but he was letting the political and policy needs of the moment out run the facts.<p>That was not the first time that he had done so. In September 2013, he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the opposition in Syria \"has increasingly become more defined by its moderation, more defined by the breadth of its membership and more defined by its adherence to some, you know, democratic process and to an all-inclusive minority-protecting constitution.\" He added that, \"the opposition is getting stronger by the day.\"<p>Mr. Kerry\'s purpose was clear.

This is \"about denying them a nuclear weapon,\" he said. \"This is a guarantee that for the next 15 to 20 years they won\'t possibly be able to advance that program.\"<p>A fair question might be how that comports with President Obama\'s description that \"in year 13, 14, 15, they have advanced centrifuges that enrich uranium fairly rapidly, and at that point the breakout times would have shrunk almost down to zero.\"<p>Mr. Kerry also claims that \"we will have accountability\" even \"when they (the Iranians) become a more legitimate member of the nonproliferation community.\" Another fair question to ask is how much the wisdom of any timelines in the agreement depend on that last assumption being correct.<p>One of the remaining issues in the current negotiations is what to make of PMDs, the possible military dimensions of the Iranian nuclear program. One could argue that assessing the adequacy of an agreement about the future of the Iranian nuclear program might be dependent on thorough knowledge about the past of that program.<p>To date, the Iranians have stiffed the International Atomic Energy Agency that has for years been trying to delve into this subject. In his PBS interview, Mr. Kerry guaranteed that the Iranians would be transparent. \"They have to do it. It will be done. If there\'s going to be a deal, it will be done.\"<p>No it won\'t. The Iranians will never come clean on PMDs. Watch to see if the agreement papers this over with some sort of language about future processes to resolve outstanding issues (which will not be honored in any meaningful way).

Misener, vice president of global public policy for Amazon.com.<p>\"If a consumer wants a small item quickly, instead of driving to go shopping or causing delivery automobiles to come to her home or office, a small, electrically-powered (drone) vehicle will make the trip faster and more efficiently and cleanly,\" Misener told the House Oversight Committee.<p>The Federal Aviation Administration proposed rules in February that would severely restrict the use of commercial drones. The House panel held a hearing Wednesday on their economic potential as well as concerns about safety and privacy.<p>FAA\'s proposed rules would require operators to keep commercial drones within eyesight at all times, which significantly limits the distance they can fly. The restriction probably would prevent drone delivery as proposed by Amazon.<p>FAA Deputy Administrator Michael Whitaker said more research is needed before the government allows their widespread use.<p>\"We are working diligently to develop a regulatory framework that will allow for innovation while ensuring the safety of other users of the airspace and people and property on the ground,\" Whitaker told the committee.<p>The rules should be finalized within a year, Whitaker said.<p>Misener urged Congress and the FAA to speed up the rules and to reconsider some of the restrictions for commercial drones. He said the technology exists to safely operate commercial drones well beyond the eyesight of the operator.<p>Misener said Amazon does not yet have the logistical capability to receive and process orders, and then deliver packages by drone within a half hour. But, he added, \"We will have it by the time the regulations are ready.\"', '108.jpg', '2015-06-17 00:00:00', 2, 4);

Putting Andre Iguodala in the starting lineup helped the Warriors even the series instead of being one loss away from vacation.<p>The next move was up to Cleveland coach David Blatt and he followed suit, playing center Timofey Mozgov for just nine minutes in Game 5 as Cavaliers played their own small lineup.<p>As Golden State looks to end the series Tuesday on the road, Blatt has to decide whether to match up with the Warriors or try to pound them when they\'re diminutive. The Cavs have lost both ways in the last two contests but might feel compelled to stick with the first option.<p>\"We were in the game the way we were playing,\" Blatt said in a postgame news conference Sunday night, defending the lack of playing time for Mozgov, who had 28 points and 10 rebounds in Game 4.<p>\"We were right there,\" Blatt said. \"So, that\'s the way we played it. … I thought that was our best chance to win the game and we were definitely in the game with a chance to win.\"<p>Asked if he would stick with that game plan, Blatt said \"not necessarily.\"<br />But it\'s probably too late to turn back.<p>The Cavs imposed their will through the first three games, slowing the pace with a LeBron James-centric offense and taking a 2-1 series lead, but the Warriors have flipped the script. They gambled that the risk of being out-rebounded wouldn\'t out-weigh the reward of more space and a faster pace.<p>Starting center Andrew Bogut, who played 28 and 25 minutes, respectively, in Games 1 and 2, played just 19 minutes total over the last three games. He didn\'t play at all on Sunday after playing just two minutes in Game 4.<p>\"We\'re trying to play faster, we\'re trying to get up and down the floor,\" Kerr said in a postgame news conference. \"It\'s just not a series for bigs right now, the way that everything has unfolded. … The reality is this is a small series and it works well for us. We\'re comfortable with this style.\"<p>It works well because Golden State\'s rotation is more versatile, with more players who can score, pass and defend at high levels. The Warriors have a number of viable options when Stephen Curry is double-teamed, and those options have more room to operate as a result of the attention he draws.<p>Conversely, the Cavs are pretty one-dimensional when they go small. James is good for 40 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists on any given night, but for help he must rely on the limited Tristan Thompson and Matthew Dellavedova, streaky shooters like J.R. Smith and Iman Shumpert, or spot-up artists like James Jones and Mike Miller.<p>The impact is even greater on the defensive end, where Cleveland gives up rim protection by Mozgov while getting little back in return. Meanwhile, Golden State gets the total package — and then some — with Iguodala. He had 14 points, eight rebounds, seven assists and no turnovers on Sunday in a team-high 42 minutes.<p>\"He does everything for us,\" Kerr said. \"He\'s our best defender on LeBron. He\'s an incredible decision maker. He rebounds. He guards everybody. When he\'s off LeBron he goes to a shooter and stays at home with the shooters and challenges shots.<p>For all of Curry\'s wondrous ball-handling and shot-making — especially some of the daggers during his 17-point fourth quarter in Game 5 — you could argue that Iguodala has been Golden State\'s most valuable player. The Warriors appeared dead before his insertion into the lineup, but they haven\'t lost since.<p>Story Continues ?', '115.jpeg', '2015-06-15 00:00:00', 2, 5);

Being on a stage, yanking down a hat, shaking the commissioner\'s hand. The small version of Bobby Portis thought about those staples of draft night in the NBA. He watched on TV in Little Rock, Arkansas and filled his head with pictures of his feet on the stage after his name was called.<p>When June 25 arrives, Portis should have his moment in Brooklyn, New York. He\'s 6-foot-11 now, and the SEC player of the year. Just 20 years old, what\'s to come can still tantalize and what has happened provides a baseline for draft deciders. That will be enough to have him summoned to the Barclays Center stage by commissioner Adam Silver. He\'ll pull on the stiff-brimmed hat of his new employer, tower over Silver and smile.<p>\"All kids dream about being there and wanting to shake the commissioner\'s hand and putting that hat on and smiling at the camera, so it\'s something I want to do, too,\" Portis said.<p>Containing laughter became an unexpected part of Portis\' visit to Washington on Monday when he was in town for a pre-draft workout with the Wizards. Running the floor, trying to show range and displaying versatility were things Portis wanted to accomplish during his work for a team that could use a multi-faceted, young power forward. When he explained he had two suits — colors and stylings to be revealed — available for draft night, Portis concluded he would look \"spiffy\" for the evening. He also found that wildly entertaining, unable to stop the laughter after the self-assessment of his projected dapperness.<p>During his two seasons of trying to yank a once flashy and lethal Arkansas program out of the muck, Portis became noted for his playing spirit. He had enough skill to be named a McDonald\'s All-American out of high school, then become the SEC freshman of the year before his ascension to being the league\'s marquee player. He revved and roared his way through two years with the Razorbacks, pulling pieces of Kevin Garnett into his game.<p>\"It kind of comes from within,\" Portis said of his outward displays.<p>Portis\' decision to go to Arkansas was not light or simple. Archie Goodwin, also from Little Rock, had shirked the Razorbacks the year before when he chose Kentucky over home. Next was Portis, who worked himself into All-American status as he grew in high school a year later. The Razorbacks had hired Mike Anderson as their coach in 2011, and he said Monday that visiting Portis, though still in high school at the time, was his \"first plan of action.\"<p>Anderson convinced Portis to help resuscitate Arkansas\' fledgling program, which had not been to the NCAA tournament since 2008. The decision to do so pressured Portis. Anderson tried to help him along. Luckily for the program, Portis\' progress was swift.<p>\"Everyone looked at him as the savior of our program,\" Anderson said. \"But, I wanted him to go at his own pace. I wanted to take the pressure from him. His pace was second-team all-SEC as a freshman. Really, he was one of my hardest-working players.\"<p>Arkansas returned to the tournament last season when Portis averaged 17.5 points, 8.9 rebounds, 1.4 blocks, 1.2 assists and 1.6 turnovers per game. He shot 53.6 percent from the field, a solid 73.7 percent at the free-throw line and, in just 30 attempts, 46.7 percent from behind the 3-point line.<p>The latter two percentages may be more telling about his NBA future than the other numbers. A love affair with the \"stretch four\" is not subsiding within the league. If Portis can become a power forward with a consistent 3-point shot, his services will be in demand.<p>\"Picking and popping, that\'s something I can do,\" Portis said.<p>During the last three years, Portis has gained 30 pounds. More will be needed. His freshman season at Arkansas, he was \"pushed around,\" according to Anderson. Portis agreed with that take on Monday. Since, he said, he has matured mentally and physically. His college coach is intrigued to see what happens the first time Portis is mashed in the NBA.<p>\"I think as he goes up there and goes against men he\'s going to get challenged,\" Anderson said. \"I mentioned to him, \'I\'d love to be there the first time you go through there and somebody just knocks you right in the head, hits you in the throat, [to] see what you\'re going to do.\' If I know him, he\'s going to get up and he\'s going to come right back at him. He\'s driven.\"<p>\"I feel like when I get into the league, there\'s going to be things I obviously have to adjust to, but that\'s just basketball,\" Portis said. \"Everything isn\'t peaches and cream.\"<p>Story Continues ?', '113.jpg', '2015-06-15 00:00:00', 2, 5);

The increase will come from a 2.6 percent increase in electricity use and a 2.1 increase in the average price of retail electricity, the agency said.<p>Consumers are receiving the dim news as utilities take tens of thousands of megawatts of coal-generated power offline to comply with a host of EPA regulations and because of the sharp increase in cheap, domestic natural gas. Regulations such as the EPA\'s mercury and air toxic standards already are having an effect on the power sector, utilities and analysts say, and the impact will be greater after the agency releases further limits on carbon emissions from power plants this summer.<p>Coal-fired facilities emit higher levels of carbon than those burning natural gas, though coal remains cheaper. The Energy Information Administration says coal power this year will cost $2.30 per million British thermal units compared with $3.86 for natural gas.<p>Still, EPA officials deny their regulations will carry negative consequences for consumers. In fact, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy argued last week that average Americans ultimately will see lower electric bills as a result of Mr. Obama\'s climate change agenda.<p>But analysts and Energy Information Administration research suggest the opposite, at least for the next decade.<p>\" EPA completely ignores the fact that building new power plants is far more expensive than maintaining existing ones. We have a situation where EPA is forcing the closures of perfectly good and affordable power plants and trying to replace them with new, more expensive plants. This means higher electricity rates for Americans,\" said Travis Fisher, an economist with the Institute for Energy Research, a Washington think tank that has been skeptical of the EPA\'s work under Mr. Obama.<p>\"EPA\'s claim that its regulation will lower electricity bills is misleading,\" Mr. Fisher said. \"In reality, electricity rates will skyrocket under the proposed rule. The only way power bills will go down is if EPA succeeds in making Americans use substantially less electricity than we currently do. It\'s like telling people that their grocery bill will go down if they\'re forced to stop buying the food they need to feed their family.\"<p>Last month, the EIA released data showing that the administration\'s carbon rules for existing power plants — known as the Clean Power Plan — will result in a spike in electricity prices. From 2020 to 2025, the EIA said, prices will be 3 percent to 7 percent higher as a result of the plan, though the agency does predict prices in many parts of the country to drop by 2030.<p>EPA officials acknowledge a short-term bump in electric bills. Ms. McCarthy told business leaders last week that consumers can expect their bills to jump by a few dollars a month immediately after the Clean Power Plan takes effect.<p>But over time, she said, Americans\' bills will drop by as much as 8 percent.<p>\"Not all carbon reduction strategies actually cost money,\" Ms. McCarthy said. \"We will not lose sight, as we do this final rule, with both the cost and benefits, particularly as it relates to the costs of electricity pricing for consumers and for businesses.\"<p>The expected increase this summer will be relatively small. According to EIA figures from 2013 — the latest data available — the average American monthly electric bill was $111.08. The projected 4.8 percent increase would add about $5.33 to a household\'s bill each month, or about $16 over the course of June, July and August.<p>Obama administration critics blame the EPA regulations, but some market analysts say a hot summer is the culprit.

On Thursday, Republicans were joined by 46 Democrats from states where medical devices are made to erase the 2.3 percent tax.<p>House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said he hoped the bill\'s bipartisan support \"will make the president reconsider.\"<p>The vote came as lawmakers prepare for a Supreme Court decision as soon as next week that could remove a more vital piece of the 2010 health care law - federal subsidies that help millions of Americans buy coverage. Eliminating that aid would have a far greater impact on the health law than ending the medical device tax.<p>The tax on medical devices took effect two years ago and was designed to help pay for the health care overhaul, which has expanded coverage for millions of people. It is imposed on equipment like artificial hearts and X-ray machines, but not items used by individuals like eyeglasses, wheelchairs or blood glucose monitors.<p>Opponents of the repeal effort say taxes the law imposed on many branches of the health care industry were outweighed by millions of added customers the law has created. They also object that opponents would pay the $24 billion, 10-year cost of repeal with bigger federal deficits.<p>In its letter threatening a veto, the White House said repeal would \"provide a large tax break to profitable corporations\" and cut money for \"financial assistance that is working to improve coverage and affordability\" of health care.<p>Repeal supporters say the tax drives up companies\' expenses, costs jobs and stifles research.

It also says the levy is forcing companies to cut research and investments.<p>\"With an aging population and growing incidences of chronic disease, now is the time for more - not less - resources to advance cures and treatments,\" Stephen J. Ubl, AdvaMed\'s president, said after the vote.<p>In January, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service issued an economic analysis saying the levy\'s impact on companies \"will likely be minimal because the tax is expected to be passed on in price and the decrease in demand would be negligible.\"<p>The service, which studies issues for Congress, projected that the tax would likely cause job losses ranging from nearly zero to 1,200 jobs.<p>A day after top House Republicans briefed GOP lawmakers on tentative plans should the Supreme Court void many of the health law\'s subsidies, House Speaker John Boehner defended the proposal.<p>Story Continues ?', '87.jpg', '2015-06-18 00:00:00', 2, 1);

But will the devices really help you get healthier?', '<p>NEW YORK (AP) - Sales of fitness trackers are climbing, and the biggest maker of the gadgets, Fitbit, made a splashy debut on the stock market Thursday. But will the devices really help you get healthier?<p>Experts agree that getting people to set goals - and then reminding them of the goals - absolutely works, and the wearable devices are built to do that. But evidence people get healthier when using fitness trackers is limited because they are new and studies of them have mostly been small or focused on specific groups of people.<p>Strapped to your wrist, shoe, or clothes, fitness trackers can grab a lot of data: how many steps you\'ve taken, where you\'ve run, how many calories you\'ve burned, how fast your heart is beating, how much oxygen you\'ve got in your blood, and how well you\'re sleeping. They can be synched with smartphones, apps and scales. They can quantify how active you are, and it\'s satisfying to set a goal, reach it, and see if you can do better.<p>That might be why fitness trackers are one of the first types of wearable technology to really take off. International Data Corp. says more than 11 million of the devices were sold in the first quarter of this year, triple sales from a year ago. Fitbit\'s product sales doubled and revenue nearly tripled in 2014.<p>Let\'s say you\'re determined to get more sleep. If you use the \"Today I Will\" feature on Jawbone\'s Up tracker, you push a button that says \"I\'m in,\" committing to your goal. The device will send you a reminder an hour before you\'re supposed to go to bed. If you\'re not meeting your sleep goals, it\'ll remind you about that, too.<p>\"Millennials seem to be wired for this kind of data, this kind of feedback,\" says Dr. Jason Mendoza, who is running small studies to see if the devices will help teenagers.<p>In one of the few completed clinical trials of fitness trackers, Dr. Lisa Cadmus-Bertram found that overweight middle-aged and older women who used a Fitbit got about an hour of additional exercise a week. A group of women who were given pedometers didn\'t improve.<p>Cadmus-Bertram thinks that if the women had received more support they might have experienced even bigger gains. But the study involved a specific group of women - they were around 60 years old, white and affluent. And they still didn\'t reach the activity goals that experts recommend.<p>The results were published in American Journal of Preventive Medicine this month. Cadmus-Bertram is preparing to launch additional studies on Garmin\'s Vivofit tracker and plans to test the LED-based heartbeat sensors in some activity trackers to see if their measurements are accurate. She said it\'s hard for researchers to keep up with the pace of innovation and new features to determine if they are really useful.<p>But even if the trackers\' benefits prove hard to quantify, experts say they may do some real good because they could change the way people think about their own habits and their approach to health. Dr. Julie Wang, who has also studied the devices, said public health experts have been trying to get people to monitor their health for years, and by encouraging people to set and meet goals, fitness trackers might actually get them to do it.<p>Mendoza and other researchers say the devices are probably most effective if they\'re one piece of a health regimen, combined with other tools like coaching.<p>Dr. Daniel Neides of the Cleveland Clinic says a simple Pebble+ fitness tracker helped him get in the best shape of his life. And Neides says he\'s not alone: the clinic started offering the devices to employees in 2013 in a program intended to reduce its costs. Employees who met step-counting or activity goals could save about $2,000 a year in out-of-pocket health care spending.<p>Neides said the program reduced medication costs, emergency room visits and hospitalizations, and sick days. He said the clinic had tried a similar program without fitness trackers, but it didn\'t work very well.<p>\"Human nature indicates that for a lot of us, we just need a gentle nudge in the right direction,\" he said. \"I look at it like a report card.

Obviously, not [for] one second [am I] happy about it,\" Federer said, adding that something similar happened a day earlier, when several children interrupted his practice session at Roland Garros. \"Normally I only speak on behalf of myself, but in this situation, I think I can speak on behalf of all the players — that that\'s where you do your job, that\'s where you want to feel safe.\"<p>Tournament director Gilbert Ysern headed to the locker room to offer a personal apology and also spoke to Federer\'s wife, Mirka, in the players\' lounge.

There\'s not that physical separation that isn\'t very pleasant.\"<p>It was, certainly as far as Federer was concerned, the most noteworthy development on Day 1 at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament.

The too-close-for-comfort encounter began with the spectator putting an arm around Federer\'s shoulder and holding up a phone to try to snap photos.

A crafty game plan by Rays\' manager Kevin Cash only made the performance more intriguing.<p>Matt Andriese was expected to be Wednesday\'s starter for Tampa Bay. Yet, Cash had a strategy in mind and gave the start to Steve Geltz. Wednesday was Geltz\'s second start of his major league career, having thrown 25-plus innings for the Rays bullpen this season. What did Cash have in mind?<p>\"We\'re going to get the most out of Geltz,\" Cash said before the game. \"We value the opportunity to use that pinch-hitter spot if it\'s a chance for us to put up some runs on the board early.\"<hr /><p> SEE ALSO: Steven Souza Jr. lifts Rays in return to Nationals Park <hr /><p>It\'s rare to see a manager think of the pinch-hitting spot that early in the game.

For that group, the horn merely delivers respite before reassembly. A full team meeting takes place, dozens of players turn toward the locker room and, like a batch of troublemakers, the offensive linemen shuffle in an opposite direction to an adjacent field for more work.<p>Callahan\'s hard-driving style embraces a simple core concept: Work, followed by more work, until it no longer feels like work. Still fit at 58 years old, nothing about the sweat-filled afternoons at Redskins Park appears to be work for Callahan. His notes are folded and tucked vertically into the backside of his shorts. He walks fast, talks loud and stands in the middle of operations for his unit. The only indicators of age are lines around his eyes and gray that is weaving through his still full head of hair.<p>\"I love it,\" Callahan said. \"I absolutely love it.

It continued to work. Left tackle Trent Williams has not taken part in practice yet because of an injured ankle. Still, Callahan\'s push is clear.<p>\"I mean, he\'s working the crap out of everybody,\" Williams said. \"He\'s getting everybody ready. He\'s a very intense coach, and he\'s not going to accept anything but your best efforts.\"<p>Last season in Dallas, where Callahan also had \"offensive coordinator\" next to his title of offensive line coach, running back DeMarco Murray led the NFL in rushing yards. It was not close. Murray\'s 1,845 yards were almost 500 more than his nearest competitor. To get there, the Cowboys eschewed their traditional pursuit of glitz in the draft when they used first-round picks to select three offensive lineman over the previous four years. Callahan arrived in 2012. Combined with the young offensive line, an already capable passing game and Murray\'s progressing abilities, Dallas was able to produce the league\'s top back last season. It finished seventh in total offense.<p>The result put fresh polish on Callahan\'s star. After winning the AFC West and appearing in the Super Bowl in his first season as the Oakland Raiders\' coach in 2002, Oakland plummeted to 4-12. Callahan was fired by Al Davis, then hired by Nebraska. His four seasons with the Cornhuskers did not go well. From 2007 through 2010, Callahan was 27-22. He was fired again, but rebounded back into the NFL. The New York Jets hired him to run the offensive line from 2008 through 2011. He joined the Cowboys in 2012.<p>Throughout the 1980s, Callahan was a collegiate assistant coach. The Chicago native started at Illinois and spent a year with Northern Arizona before becoming offensive coordinator at Southern Illinois. In the summer, Callahan ventured to Carlisle, Pennsylvania to watch Redskins practices. His affinity for the work of Washington offensive line coach Joe Bugel began then.<p>In the late 1990s, he ran the offensive line of the Philadelphia Eagles. His first season in Philadelphia, Callahan coached former Hogs member Raleigh McKenzie. After being hired by the Redskins, Callahan hung a photo of The Hogs in his office. It\'s his carrot.<p>\"We\'re trying to emulate that and carry on that tradition here and try to live up to the standards that they have,\" Callahan said.<p>Changes to the Redskins\' offensive line since Callahan arrived have been swift. Right guard Chris Chester, who made 64 consecutive starts, was released. Guards Josh LeRibeus and Spencer Long, penciled in as Chester\'s replacement, are receiving more work. Callahan said every guard other than Shaun Lauvao is \"cross-training\" at center. Rookie right tackle Brandon Scherff, selected fifth overall, is learning how to hold up outside.<p>According to Jay Gruden, Callahan will be advised for play-calling input, particularly in the running game. Murray\'s success in a power running scheme last season in Dallas prompted wonder about the style Callahan and the Redskins will use this season. At this point, Callahan said the line will be flexible, whether its approach is more downhill or zone-oriented.<p>Callahan is soon to go through a withdrawal period. The Redskins have one practice still on the schedule before a six-week break until training camp opens in Richmond on July 30. He can watch tape and continue to explore technique — the latter something he feels is an endless pursuit.

Terms of the sale allow Hilton to run the hotel for the next 100 years but also call for \"a major renovation\" that officials say has raised eyebrows in Washington, where fears of Chinese eavesdropping and cyberespionage run high.<p>The U.S. suspects China-linked hackers were behind a recent massive breach of federal personnel records that compromised the data of millions of government workers.<p>Both the White House and the State Department declined to comment on the hotel choice for the U.N. General Assembly.<p>At the time of the October 2014 sale, officials said it could have implications for the U.S. government\'s longstanding relationship with the hotel. They said decisions about the relationship would be made on cost, Anbang\'s plans, the government\'s needs and security concerns with an eye on the renovation project.<p>The State Department routinely warns U.S. diplomats in China about physical and electronic surveillance and tells American citizens in the country to be aware of similar risks, notably in hotels.<p>\"Hotel rooms (including meeting rooms), offices, cars, taxis, telephones, Internet usage and fax machines may be monitored onsite or remotely, and personal possessions in hotel rooms, including computers, may be searched without your consent or knowledge,\" the department\'s travel advice for China says.<p>\"Business travelers should be particularly mindful that trade secrets, negotiating positions and other business-sensitive information may be taken and shared with local interests,\" it says.<p>The officials said the State Department\'s decision probably would affect the traveling operations of the White House, which also sends large numbers of officials to New York for the General Assembly, including the president, who has in the past stayed at the Waldorf.<p>It was not immediately clear whether the Waldorf residence of the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations would be moved to another location. The State Department has leased an apartment for the ambassador on the 42nd floor of the hotel\'s Waldorf Towers for more than 50 years.<p>U.S. law allows the department to rent the ambassador\'s residence for a term of 10 years or less.

This is mainly because banks — due to their compliance regulations — don\'t issue loans to people with a high credit risk after evaluating their credit history.<p>The result is high-risk pools of people going to payday lenders, which assume everyone has a 100 percent chance of default and charges high interest rates to make up for it.<p>\"I\'m under no illusion that payday lenders are saints or the best industry in the world.

The actual World Cup is more of a three-week event, but it\'s more like a ten-year building process where you use the World Cup as an excuse to build billions of dollars in general infrastructure.\"<p>Money scandals are nothing new to international sporting events. Mitt Romney famously was called in to rescue the troubled Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in 2002 after revelations surfaced of extensive bribes by members of the organizing committee to win the rights to the games. Even in ancient Greece, judges at the original Olympic Games were often accused of taking bribes and entering their own horses in equestrian events.<p>Sports economist and author Andrew Zimbalist, who teaches at Smith College, said the problem runs deeper. It\'s a system, he told NPR in a recent interview, virtually guaranteed to encourage graft and bribery.<p>\"You have one seller in the case of the Olympics: the [International Olympic Committee]. You have one seller in the case of World Cup: FIFA,\" he noted. \"And you have cities, or countries, from around the world that are bidding against each other, so you have multiple buyers and one seller.\"<p>The result: \"It\'s a monopoly situation, and the monopolist takes advantage of that.\"<p>Upfront costs vs. long-term payoff<p>Mr. Matheson explained that when the U.S. hosted the event in 1994, it brought around 2.5 million spectators, most of whom were visitors from outside the country. When South Africa staged the 2010 World Cup, the first African nation to host the tournament, at least 200,000 more tourists than usual came to the country during the course of the tournament.<p>But despite the benefits of long-term infrastructure improvements, the upfront cost in hosting a global event like the World Cup or the Olympics vastly outweighs the potential payoff.<p>\"From a pure dollars-and-cents standpoint, it makes absolutely zero sense for a country like Qatar, or even a country like Russia, to host the World Cup,\" said Mr. Matheson. \"They\'re spending billions of dollars on stadiums when they have no soccer league. It\'s difficult to see how they\'re possibly going to make any money back on this.\"<p>This would not be the first major sport-related boondoggle for Moscow. The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, whose full cost is incalculable but was widely reported to cost the state around $50 billion, drew criticism on several fronts for its cost and location in a subtropical region close to previously embattled regions of Chechnya and Ossetia.<p>Story Continues ?', '6.jpg', '2015-05-28 00:00:00', 2, 5);

Lawson\'s career has been unique. She has played professionally since she was 23 years old, but also worked in television. Currently also an analyst for ESPN, she spoke with The Washington Times about playing at that stage, women in broadcasting and what changes she would make to the league.<p>Question: What keeps bringing you back to play more?<br />Answer: The first thing is, I really enjoy doing it. I love the game. For me, toward the end of my career, to have a chance to play in my hometown, to play for [Mystics coach] Mike [Thibault], who I really enjoy playing for — [I] played for [him] up in Connecticut. I feel like I\'m learning, I\'m improving as a player. I just figure, as long as I feel like I can contribute, I\'d love to be out there.<p>Q: How is your body responding?<br />A: I feel good. We only play the 34-game schedule in the WNBA. What those guys do in the NBA is a ton. Fortunately, for me, I haven\'t had to go overseas in my career. A lot of our players are actually logging more games than the NBA guys do by virtue of combining the two seasons. I\'ve only played 34 games because I\'ve been doing the broadcasting. I feel really good. Obviously, stuff takes a little longer than it used to. I have to spend more time warming up and cooling down. Make sure I get my rest and recovery. I just have to be more in tune with my body than I did say 10 years ago.<p>Q: What were some of the early lessons you learned when you moved into broadcasting?<br />A: The thing about the WNBA is we play opposite the traditional basketball season. So, that enabled me to cover the traditional basketball season. Most athletes are retired; most, if not all, are retired before they cover their sport. And I was able to start, at 23, doing both full-time. What that enabled me to do is get an incredible foundation and learn a lot. I don\'t know if you believe in [Malcolm] Gladwell\'s 10,000-hour rule, where you kind of get a lot of stuff [and learn], well, I just got a ton of reps very early. So, by the time people started to see me, on a national basis, I had actually already done my 10,000 hours. It looked like I was polished and it looked like I had it all together. At the beginning, I was fortunate enough not only to work with ESPN at 23, but I worked with the Sacramento Kings and their local TV package. So, I was doing 70 NBA games a year just locally, so nobody was seeing me except, like, Sacramento. I think that\'s where I really learned TV. When you do 70 nights of television year after to year — I worked about 3 1/2 seasons for the Kings until my ESPN schedule got too hard to do both, I was getting more and more opportunities at the national level, so I had to stop doing the Kings — but I think that\'s how I learned.<p>Q: How do you view the role of female basketball broadcasters? Has that market opened?<br />A: I think the market has opened up a lot. It\'s been open first to reporters, right? We saw kind of an influx of female reporters 15 years ago. I think in the last five years, we\'ve seen a lot of increase in terms of hosting. Sage Steele, Hannah [Storm] has done hosting, you look at Rebecca Lowe at NBC doing the Premier League, there\'s a lot of people that have been able to break in and do that. The analyst, I don\'t want to call it the last frontier, but it\'s coming a lot slower than the other two. I\'m trying to think in terms of analysts, outside of Doris [Burke] and myself, I don\'t know if there are other analysts. Julie Foudy did some World Cup, Jessica Mendoza does some Baseball Tonight. It\'s still slow on the analyst side. I think sometimes people look at television and say, \"Look at all the women doing stuff.\" It\'s great. There are, but for the role that I do, there\'s not.<p>Q: Did you ever worry about the opinion of the people you are critiquing, such as other players?<br />A: I just think you\'re honest. You\'re honest with your opinions and true to yourself. It\'s so subjective. Everyone\'s style is different, in how they cover and talk about games. I just like to say what I see. If a team or a player is doing something well, there\'s a reason why they\'re doing something well, so tell people what it is they\'re doing well. If someone is performing poorly, there\'s a reason why they\'re performing poorly. Whether it\'s something they\'re doing or something the opponent\'s doing. It\'s my job to point that out. It has nothing to do with what I feel about a player, what I feel about a team, what I feel about a university. It has everything to do with doing your job. So, I\'ve never before I said something thought, \"I wonder how this is going to go over.\" Because I just say what I see, as soon as I see it. I don\'t have time to edit or anything like that. There are certain issues that sometimes come up within a sport, that you do think about it. A lot of times, if it\'s off-the-court issues, something with the NCAA or stuff with a player getting in trouble or a coach getting in trouble, there are issues that are kind of outside the lines where, yeah, you do have to put a great deal of thought into what your stance is going to be and what you feel about it. I find I spend more time thinking about those types of issues.<p>Q: When you see a star like Diana Taurasi take the WNBA season off because of her overseas commitments, does that concern you?<br />A: I wasn\'t surprised. I knew that was coming. Something that I\'ve known is coming for a long time. Players are burned out. You get to the point where you\'re Diana\'s age [33] and you\'ve been playing year-round, you get to your late 20s as a player, you\'ve been doing that year-round thing, you\'ve got to take time off. It\'s a simple economic question. Somebody\'s been paying you, you know, $100,000 for six months and someone is paying $1 million for the other six months and you need to take six months off, what six months are you going to take off? Right? Everybody\'s going to make the same decision. Nobody is upset with Diana, from the players\' perspective. It just makes financial sense for her to be able to prolong her career and there\'s a number of players that are doing it this year in some form or fashion. It\'s not just Diana. Candace Parker is taking part of the season off. Janel McCarville, she\'s taking the summer off. It only really applies to a certain percentage of players in our league, a small percentage of players in our league. The ones that have those overseas contracts that are so much larger than WNBA contracts. Not everybody is making that type of money overseas. But, the ones that do, I think it is always going to be there until the salaries are at a point where it\'s a harder decision.<p>Q: If you had the power to make changes in the WNBA, what would you change?<br />A: Most of my changes would be more player-centric, because I\'m a player and that\'s how I\'ve always participated in this league and I don\'t know a lot of the business side of things because there\'s two sides. There\'s the ownership side and the players\' side. For me, as a player, I would try to have, kind of like the NBA has done, less back-to-backs. We have a schedule where we just played a back-to-back to open the season, then we didn\'t play for six days. We have the gaps in our season to be able to stretch games out. For some reason, we just have clumps of games, then we have stretches where we play like two games in 13 days. If you look at our schedule, you\'ll see it. It happens in June, it happens in August. Then, all of a sudden, you play five in nine. That takes its toll. Particularly for us, because we fly commercially. We have to get up at 6 a.m. and get the Southwest Airlines flight and get to the next city.<p>Q: Is your 2008 Olympic gold medal your biggest winning achievement?<br />A: Certainly, that\'s the top of our sport. That\'s as good as it gets. That\'s probably my greatest accomplishment, is being a part of that team and winning. For me, there is a lot of satisfaction to contribute. Not just be on the team, but being somebody the team depended on to help make plays. … I just love playing. I look back on my career, I\'m like, \"Man, I\'ve gotten to do what I always wanted to do since I was 5 or 6 years old, and that\'s just play basketball.\" I wake up every day, and my job is to drive into Verizon Center — which I remember when it was built — I used to go to Cap Center and watch the Bullets play over in Landover. My job now is actually in this arena. It\'s just an incredible feeling for me to play here in my hometown.', '3.jpg', '2015-06-17 00:00:00', 2, 5);

Stan Wawrinka and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga will meet in the other semifinal.<p>\"I feel like I understand how I have to play on the surface better than I did in the past,\" said Murray, who is 15-0 on clay in 2015.<p>In the women\'s semifinals on Thursday, Serena Williams plays Timea Bacsinszky, and Ana Ivanovic meets Lucie Safarova. Williams advanced with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over Sara Errani, and Bacsinszky beat Alison Van Uytvanck, 6-4, 7-5.<p>Story Continues ?', '38.jpeg', '2015-06-03 00:00:00', 2, 5);

His style is calm but firm, old-school but laid-back. His method?<p>\"He likes music,\" safety Phillip Thomas said. \"He teaches through music.\"<p>In his first offseason as the Washington Redskins\' defensive backs coach, Fewell has spent much of his time teaching new coverage schemes and principles to a largely-rebuilt secondary. Each concept is relayed in stages. Each lesson builds upon the next. Many are reinforced by song lyrics — Michael Jackson, for example. In most cases, music is Fewell\'s guide.<p>\"His teaching methods are a little bit different,\" cornerback DeAngelo Hall said. \"But I like it, man. I think he\'s going to be good for us. I think he brings a calmness to us, as a group.\"<p>The Redskins had one of the worst secondaries in the NFL last season under previous defensive backs coach Raheem Morris. With a group of cornerbacks that were too young and safeties that were too old, they gave up 35 passing touchdowns, the most in the league, and 7.2 net yards per passing play, the second-most in the league. Morris is now in Atlanta, filling the same coaching role, and Fewell is tasked with turning a horrendous unit around.<p>A wave of new additions will help. This winter, the Redskins signed former San Francisco 49ers cornerback Chris Culliver and former Seattle Seahawks strong safety Jeron Johnson. They traded a sixth-round draft pick to Tampa Bay in exchange for safety Dashon Goldson. With Hall and strong safety Duke Ihenacho back from injuries, the unit should have an entirely new feel.<p>\"We knew we had to do some work,\" Fewell said. \"We had to re-tool with some personnel. We thought we had some good young players that just needed to be developed, and then if we can mix it with some veterans that help them get some stability, some knowledge and know-how, we thought we could improve our secondary.\"<p>Between the team\'s numerous free agent additions, both in the secondary and along the defensive line, and the arrival of new defensive coordinator Joe Barry, Fewell joined the Redskins in the midst of a complete defensive overhaul.<br />That\'s a good thing, he said. It paves the way for a fresh start.<p>\"I can\'t speak for what happened last year. I can only speak for what we have this year,\" Fewell said. \"But I think we have a really good group. We\'re communicating well with each other, and there\'s still a lot of growing to do.\"<p>Fewell spent the past five seasons as defensive coordinator of the New York Giants, helping lead them to a Super Bowl title in 2012 and interviewing for a handful of coaching jobs in the years since — including with the Redskins last year, when they eventually hired Jay Gruden. He was fired by the Giants in the offseason and drawn to Washington by Gruden, as well as an opportunity to stay in the NFC East.<p>Fewell also said a return to position coaching was alluring. The North Carolina native is now in the same role in which he broke into the league with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 1998.<p>\"Having fun, getting back in the secondary, being in the meetings every day with the players and being more of a position coach — it\'s kind of refreshing to do that,\" Fewell said. \"Obviously, yes, I want to become a coordinator. I want to be a head coach again. But just being back in the secondary room, that was appealing.\"<p>Gruden said Fewell\'s familiarity with the rest of the division will help. His prior experience as a defensive coordinator should make a significant impact, too.<p>\"One, he\'s a great person. Very loyal guy,\" Gruden said. \"And two, he\'s been productive where he\'s been. He\'s been in the division, he knows the division, he knows the opponents, knows the Giants, obviously. And [he has a] great wealth of knowledge.\"<p>The defensive backs are still getting to know Fewell, but already they have noticed a difference in coaching styles. The 52-year-old Fewell is a self-anointed disciplinarian. Multiple players described him as \"old school.\" While Morris was more animated and likely to crack jokes, Fewell is more stern.<p>Story Continues ?', '4.jpg', '2015-06-16 00:00:00', 2, 5);
